answers = ['Add more RAM to the computer']
alternatives = ['Increase the size of the virtual memory file', 'Close some applications', 'The technician should do nothing; virtual memory works best when the file is full']
explanation = "The best answer for performance is to add RAM. It is generally recommended to let the operating system manage the size of the virtual memory file.  Closing applications is a short-term solution but eventually, the user will reopen them.

alternatives = ['Identify the problem by removing all hardware components from the motherboard', 'remove the RAM and replace with new modules', 'Verify full system functionality by rebooting the PC ']
explanation = "CompTIA’s Troubleshooting Methodology offers a simplified list of steps that can help you troubleshoot and resolve almost any issue that you will run in to. After establishing and testing a theory, the next step would be to establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution. Since we surmised that our RAM sticks weren’t seated properly, the solution to the would be to reseat the RAM."

answers = ['It performs diagnostic tests before booting the operating system']
alternatives = ['It is an add-on card to test the computer', 'It applies power to the CPU', 'It enables hardware to function before the OS boots']
explanation = "POST is a program in the computer's BIOS chip that performs diagnostics prior to the computer booting an operating system. POST can send messages to a POST card but the card does not contain the POST program. A power supply provides power to the CPU. POST does not enable hardware, it tests hardware."

question_number = "PM A+ 1 - 5 4"
question = "For which failures would you expect POST to issue beep codes?"
answers = ['Video card']
alternatives = ['Missing keyboard', 'No CPU installed', 'No printer found']
explanation = "Beep codes are issued when error messages can't be displayed on the screen, thus a bad video card would cause beep codes. Missing keyboard, printers, and network connection failures can all be shown on a screen. The POST program will not run at all without a CPU installed (and thus would not generate a beep code)."

question = "To prevent random people from booting the OS, a technician should do what?"
answers = ['Set a user password']
alternatives = ['Set an administrator password', 'Flash the BIOS chip', 'Remove the CMOS battery']
explanation = "A user password prevents the OS from booting until the password is entered. The administrator password prevents access to the setup program until the password is entered. Flashing the BIOS is for fixing bugs and adding features to the contents of the BIOS chip. Removing the CMOS battery might prevent the OS from booting, but it is not the best answer."

alternatives = ['The I/O shield must be customized to fit the case', 'The dimensions of the I/O shield for a Micro-ATX motherboard are 9.6 inches by 9.6 inches', 'All I/O shields are standardized to fit all motherboard I/O areas']
explanation = "I/O shields are customized to fit the motherboard I/O area.  I/O shields have standard dimensions to fit standard form factor cases.  Micro-ATX motherboards are 9.6 x 9.6, not their I/O shields. Different motherboards have different I/O ports so it is impossible to create a one-size-fits-all I/O shield for different motherboards."

question = "The small, metal items that screw into a case and keep the motherboard from touching the case are called:"
answers = ['Standoffs']
alternatives = ['Dongles', 'Slots', 'I/O shields']
explanation = "Standoffs are the screws used to keep the motherboard from touching the case so that there isn't an electric short, which could damage the components. Slots are for plugging in RAM and expansion cards. I/O shields protect the motherboard from dust and debris."

question = "How can you protect your system from ESD while installing the motherboard?"
answers = ['Antistatic wrist strap']
alternatives = ['I/O shields', 'Drinking hot coffee over your system', 'Use fans to blow cool air throughout the room']
explanation = "Antistatic (or ESD) wrist straps protect from ESD by dispersing the electricy generated by your body so it doesn't get dispersed into the components instead. I/O shields protect the motherboard from dust and debris. Drinking hot coffee over a system you're building is NEVER a good idea, as liquids can ruin electronic equipment. Using fans to blow cool air throughout the room isn't necessary at this point of your PC build, since none of the heat-producing componenets are installed and turned on yet."

question = "Which must be done before installing a motherboard into a case?"
answers = ['Install the I/O shield']
alternatives = ['Install case fans', 'Install the SATA cables', 'Install a video card into a PCIe slot']
explanation = "The I/O shield must be installed before the motherboard is installed; it won't fit after the board is in place. Case fans and SATA cables can be installed at any time. Installing a video card into the motherboard may make it challenging or impossible to install the motherboard into the case."

answers = ['Modular power supply']
alternatives = ['Soldered power supply', 'Option power supply', 'Flex power supply']
explanation = "A modular power supply simplifies cable management by enabling you to add and remove optional plug-in cables as needed to power components. Option power supply is a made-up term.

answers = ['Provides wall power to the power supply']
alternatives = ['Turns on the computer', 'Applies power to the "power good" wire', 'Nothing; power supplies autodetect power and turn on or off accordingly']
explanation = "It allows power to flow from the plug into the power supply. The computer has its own on/off switch.

question = "Which is a primary characteristic to be considered when choosing a power supply?"
answers = ['Efficiency']
alternatives = ['Cable lengths', 'UPS compatibility', 'Power sag rating']
explanation = "Efficiency is a major consideration. Cable length is important, but most power cables are of sufficient length and don't typically need to be measured or checked. Power supplies do not have a sag rating. UPS compatibility is not a real specification."
